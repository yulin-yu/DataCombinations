DataComb_Full.csv: This file includes all the final cleaned metadata used for analysis, with each row representing a single paper. The final dataset was created by integrating, cleaning, and quantifying variables from three large-scale datasets: Altmetric data: Available free of charge to researchers at Altmetric（https://www.altmetric.com/research-access/）.
Publication records: Extracted from OpenAlex, a publicly accessible dataset（https://docs.
